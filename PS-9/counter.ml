Reflection on the problem set

After each problem set, we'll ask you to reflect on your experience.
We care about your responses and will use them to help guide us in
creating and improving future assignments.

........................................................................
Please give us an honest (if approximate) estimate of how long (in
minutes) this problem set (in total, not just this file) took you to
complete.

(*......................................................................
It's worth reflecting on the work you did on this problem set, where
you ran into problems and how you ended up resolving them. What might
you have done in retrospect that would have allowed you to generate as
good a submission in less time? Please provide us your thoughts in the
string below.

enjoyed the experiments I did, plotting simulations for what it would look like
for the coronavirus to spread in places that matter to me, something
I care about!" ;;
